- **1.1.0**
    
    -   **Bug Fixes:**
      - Fixed an issue where items would not spawn after completing Void Field cells.
      - Fixed a bug that prevented the False Son from spawning after the cutscene in the Prime Meridian fight.
      - Fixed a bug that prevented Mithrix from spawning after the cutscene at the apex of Commencement.
    
    -   **Changes:**
      - The mod is no longer purely client-side. All players in a session (including clients) must now have the mod installed for it to work correctly.
        (Previously, only the host needed it.)
      
    -   **Improvements:**
      - Optimized the handling of gold-related visual effects to prevent unintended interactions with the game's reward system.
    
    -   **Miscellaneous:**
      - Probably many more currently unknown interactions have been fixed or altered.
